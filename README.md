Dicelist
========
Dicelist is a collection of word lists for making secure 
passwords with the help of 4-5 dice.

Advice
======
A passphrase of a few random words is far more easy to remember, than a password 
of many random characters.

The list for 5 dice contains 7776 words of 2-6 letters, while the list 
for 4 dice contains 1296 words of 2-4 letters.

Preferably, use the list for 5 dice. Then you have to remember just 6 words. 
If it's important to you that the words are short and not uncommon, use the 
short list for 4 dice instead. Then you have to remember 8 words, but they are 
more current.

Usage
=====
Use 5 dice to randomly get a combination of digits between 11111 and 66666, 
that corresponds to a word in the default list. Or at your option, use 4 dice 
to randomly get a combination of digits between 1111 and 6666, that 
corresponds to a word in the short list.

If you get some words you don't recognize in your password, or don't know what 
they mean: look them up in a dictionnary or search for them on the internet to 
learn what they stand for. They will then be more easy for you to remember.

A passphrase consisting of 6 random words from the default list or 8 random 
words from the short list has a security similar to a password consisting 
of 12 random characters chosen from a set consisting of upper and lower case 
characters (a-z), numbers and symbols.

Contributions are welcome
=========================

If you find words you don't like in a list, feel free 
to make a pull request with your proposal for change.

Make a wordlist in your own language. It's fairly 
easy if your language is used in Apertium. See www.apertium.org
Otherwise, you can gather a lot of text to make a large corpus and create a 
frequenzy list. Remove long and infrequent words. Nouns and verbs are a first 
hand choice. Please, look in the folder 'resources' for more information.
